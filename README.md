# DIP-Project-ThermalCamera
This is the project respository for my Digital Image Processing course. In this project, I will use the image from regular camera to enhance thermal images from the senser MLX90640, which each time return a thermal matrix of scale 24*32. It is believed that the combination will result in a thermal image will much more details and higher resolusion
